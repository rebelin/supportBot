Let yourself heal
Never apologize for how you feel
Don't carry too much baggage
Let's not try to solve everyone's problems
Learn to rest, not quit
Be patient, some things take time
Take time to recharge
Stars shine brightest in the dark
If you don't pick a pick a day to relax your body will pick it for you
